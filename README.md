## Basic Description

This repo contains an implementation of XML-PRIDE (e**X**treme **M**ulti-**L**abel classification based on dee**P** lea**R**n**I**ng with **D**ense prop**E**rties
) that leverages the idea of subsampling examples from data to reduce the negative impact of training loss. Specifically, leADS performs an iterative procedure to: (a)- constructing an acquisition model in an ensemble framework; (b) subselect informative examples using an acquisition function (entropy, mutual information, variation ratios, normalized propensity scored precision at k); and (c)- train on reduced selected examples. The ensemble approach was sought to enhance the generalization ability of the multi-label learning systems by concurrently building and executing a group of multi-label base learners, where each is assigned a portion of samples, to ensure proper learning of class labels (e.g. pathways). leADS was evaluated on the pathway prediction task using 10 multi-organism pathway datasets, where the experiments revealed that leADS achieved very compelling and competitive performances against the state-of-the-art pathway inference algorithms.

medGAN implements the algorithm introduced in the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06490):

#### Code Description

This code trains a generative adversarial network to generate patient records. This work currently can handle patient
records that are aggregated over time, hence represented as a matrix where a row corresponds to a patient, and a column
to a specific medical code (e.g. diagonsis code, medication code, or procedure code). The value of the matrix could
either be binary (i.e. a specific medical code occurred in the longitudinal patient record or not) or count (i.e. how
many times a specific medical code occurred in the longitudinal patient record).

#### Running GRAM

**STEP 1: Installation**

1. medGAN was implemented to run on [TensorFlow](https://www.python.org/) 1.2. TensorFlow can be easily installed in
   Ubuntu as suggested [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)

2. Download/clone the medGAN code

**STEP 2: Fast way to test medGAN with MIMIC-III**  
This step describes how to train medGAN, with minimum number of steps using MIMIC-III.

0. You will first need to request access for [MIMIC-III](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/), a publicly
   avaiable electronic health records collected from ICU patients over 11 years.

1. You can use "process_mimic.py" to process MIMIC-III dataset and generate a suitable training dataset for medGAN.
   Place the script to the same location where the MIMIC-III CSV files are located, and run the script. The execution
   command is `python process_mimic.py ADMISSIONS.csv DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv <output file> <"binary"|"count">`. Note that the
   last argument decides whether you construct a binary matrix or a count matrix. The above command will extract ICD9
   diagnosis codes from MIMIC-III. Mind that this script will use only 3 digits of the ICD9 diagnosis code. If you want
   to use all 5 digits, please see the source code of "process_mimic.py".

2. Run medGAN using the ".matrix" file generated by process_mimic.py. The command is:
   `python medgan.py <matrix file> <output path> --data_type=["binary", "count"]`.

3. After the training, if you want to generate synthetic records, use this command :
   `python medgan.py <matrix file> <generated output path> --model_file=<trained output path> --generate_data=True`.
   Note that `<matrix file>` is not actually used for generating synthetic records, so it is just a dummy input.
